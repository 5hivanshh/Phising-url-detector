phising URL detection

This project aims to detect phishing URLs using machine learning techniques implemented within a Django web application. Phishing is a significant threat in cybersecurity, where attackers create deceptive URLs to trick users into disclosing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data. By utilizing machine learning models, we can automate the process of identifying these malicious URLs and mitigate potential risks to users.

Features Phishing URL Detection: The system employs multiple machine learning models to accurately classify URLs as either phishing or legitimate. User Interface: Built using Django framework, the web application provides an intuitive interface for users to input URLs and receive classification results. Model Training: Includes functionalities for training and fine-tuning machine learning models based on evolving datasets to enhance detection accuracy. Admin Panel: Administrators can manage users, view logs, and monitor system performance through the Django admin interface. Security: Measures are implemented to ensure the security of user data and prevent unauthorized access to the system. Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing easy integration of additional machine learning models and expansion of the system's capabilities.

Usage 1.Input a URL into the provided field on the dashboard. 2.Click on the "Detect" button to initiate the phishing URL detection process. 3.View the classification result indicating whether the URL is classified as phishing or legitimate. 4.Optionally, administrators can access the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin to manage users, view logs, and monitor system performance.
